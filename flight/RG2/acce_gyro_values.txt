acc:  +/- 2, 4, 8, or 16g   m/t^2
gyro: +/- 250, 500, 1000, or 2000 deg/sec    (rotational velocity)

scale: 
[-32768, +32767]

The scale of each depends on the sensitivity settings chosen, which can be one of  for the 
and one of  for the gyroscope. 

The accelerometer produces data in units of acceleration (distance over time2), 
and the gyroscope produces data in units of rotational velocity (rotation distance over time).


The output scale for any setting is  for each of the six axes. 
The default setting in the I2Cdevlib class is +/- 2g for the accel and +/- 250 deg/sec for the gyro. 


If the device is perfectly level and not moving, then:

    X/Y accel axes should read 0
    Z accel axis should read 1g, which is +16384 at a sensitivity of 2g
    X/Y/Z gyro axes should read 0

In reality, the accel axes won't read exactly 0 since it is difficult to be perfectly level and there is some noise/error, 
and the gyros will also not read exactly 0 for the same reason (noise/error).
